## Kernel

* ✔ ~~_run_, _rename_, _delete_ and _chgaatr_, are not taking in consideration the full filename (e.g. _disk_ is acting on file _diskinfo_)~~
* ✔ ~~Keyboard controller is sending character for each press of special keys (e.g. Shift)~~
* KRN_DZFS_GET_BAT_FREE_ENTRY not finished
  * ✔ Read entire BAT
  * Store first entry (if any) with $7E as first byte
  * ✔ If found entry with $00 as first byte, return this entry's number
  * Else, return entry's number of the entry with $7E as first byte
  * If no $00 nor $7E, return $FFFF as entry number to indicate error
* Message "....Detecting RTC  [ RTC Battery needs replacement ] ....Detecting NVRAM  [ 56 Bytes ]" lacks CarriageReturn

## CLI

* ✔ ~~Results of _cat_ command are longer than 80 columns.~~
* ✔ ~~_halt_ makes the computer to reset.~~
* _clrram_ executed after loading MS BASIC, hangs the computer
* ✔ ~~Backspace is not reflected in _CLI_buffer_full_cmd_~~
* Files on disk can be run directly by simply entering the filename as a CLI command, but CLI is not checking if the file is an EXE or not.

## VDP

* ✔ ~~There are some artifacts on the Composite Video screen, due to some bad data in the VDP's Colour Table.~~
