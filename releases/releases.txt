    BIOS & Kernel talk to Serial Interface to communicate with the Keyboard.
    BIOS & Kernel talk with the Video Interface to generate VGA output.

    Added commands: save, crc16
    Solved bug that allowed file commands to work with partial filenames.
    Added partial support for backspace (works well at the end of the line, but not so well in the middle).
    BIOS, Kernel and CLI are now set as v0.1.0 until I decide are stable enough to move to v1.0.0

dzOS.2022.09.06.4.bin (old)
    Added command: clrram
    Solved bug that made mmedump not print more addresses after pressing space.
    Solved bug where Kernel was calling KRN_SERIAL_WR6DIG_NOLZEROS instead of the jumpblock version F_KRN_SERIAL_WR6DIG_NOLZEROS.

dzOS.2022.10.03.4.bin (old)
    Solved bug in save command. Now it saves coprrectly files of any size. Before only saved files with size multiple of 512.

    First release of Mark II, which mainly adds support for TMS9918A VDP.
    Show a logo via the Composite Video Output (VDP).
    Moved Jumpblocks to the end of the ROM address, so that it doesn't get modified everytime I change code on the BIOS and/or Kernel.
    Bootstrap now copies the entire ROM to Low RAM, because jumpblocks are at the end.
    'memdump' is now a stand-alone program supplied as part of the 'dzSoftware' repo.
    Added a main .asm program with all includes. As a result:
        Simplified Makefile
        Instead of multiple .exp files, now there is only sysvars.exp and dzOs.exp

dzOS.2022.12.25.13.07.bin (old)
    Solved bug that made the dastaZ80 logo display some artifacts.

dzOS.2023.01.11.18.28.bin (old)
    Added more functions for TMS9918A VDP.
        Initialise for all modes.
        Print a character at an XY position.
        Wait for VBLANK.
        Copy blocks of RAM to VRAM.

dzOS.2023.11.12.14.50.bin (current)
    Added bq4845 RTC with its own board backed up with a 3V button cell battery.
    Removed RTC from ASMDC.
    Removed NVRAM code, because bq4845 doesn't have NVRAM.
    Added bq4845 RTC with its own board backed up with a 3V button cell battery.
    Added more information to Manuals and Guides.
    VGA messages colours defined (and modifiable) in SYSVARS.
    Files now can be run directly as if it were CLI commands.
    Changed logo on VDP for text message, to save bytes in ROM image.
    Solved bugs:
        File Size not printed in same column when had no attribs.
        Changed BIOS_VDP_VBLANK_WAIT because of possible bug in the VDP hardware implementation.
    New subroutines:
        Added F_KRN_STRCHR and F_KRN_STRCHRNTH functions.
        Added KRN_VDP_CHG_COLOUR_BORDER.
    Tweaks:
        Changed 'ld A,0' for 'xor 0' because it's 3 clock cycles faster, and occupies 1 byte less.
        Added push/pop in parse_get_command, that saves 354 clock cycles.
