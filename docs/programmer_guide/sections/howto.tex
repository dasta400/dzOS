    \subsection{Read data from DISK}
    % ==========================================================================
    \label{sec:howto_readdata}
    Given \texttt{DISK\_is\_formatted} is equal to \texttt{0xFF} (i.e.
    \textbf{DISK} is formatted with DZFS file system), call
    \hyperref[func:fkrndzfsloadfiletoram]{F\_KRN\_DZFS\_LOAD\_FILE\_TO\_RAM}
    with \texttt{DE} equal to first sector (512 bytes) to read and \texttt{IX}
    equal to how many sectors to read.

    Read bytes will be copied into \textbf{MEMORY}, following these rules:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item if \textit{\hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{DISK\_loadsave\_addr}} $<>$
        0, load bytes to this address.
        \item if \textit{\hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{DISK\_loadsave\_addr}} = 0,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item if \textit{\hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{DISK\_cur\_file\_load\_addr}}
            $<>$ 0, load bytes to this address.
            \item if \textit{\hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{DISK\_cur\_file\_load\_addr}}
            = 0, load bytes to start of \hyperref[subsec:memmap:ram]{Free RAM}
            (\texttt{0x4420}).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \label{sec:howto_writedata}
    Given \texttt{DISK\_is\_formatted} is equal to \texttt{0xFF} (i.e.
    \textbf{DISK} is formatted with DZFS file system):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Store the filename (in ASCII) somewhere in \textbf{MEMORY}.
        \item call \hyperref[func:fkrndzfsgetfilebatentry]{F\_KRN\_DZFS\_GET\_FILE\_BATENTRY},
            with \texttt{HL} equal to the \texttt{MEMORY} address where the
            filename is stored. If a file with the specified filename does not
            exist, flag \texttt{z} will be set to indicate that it is OK to save
            the file.
        \item call \hyperref[func:fkrndzfscreatenewfile]{F\_KRN\_DZFS\_CREATE\_NEW\_FILE},
            with:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \texttt{HL} equal to the address in \textbf{MEMORY} of
                first byte to be stored.
                \item \texttt{BC} equal to the total number of bytes to
                be stored.
                \item \texttt{IX} equal to the address in \textbf{MEMORY}
                where the filename is stored.
                \item \textit{\hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{DISK\_loadsave\_addr}}
                equal to:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item zero, will use the address in \textbf{MEMORY} of first
                    byte as the load address when loading the file (i.e. 
                    \textit{\hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{DISK\_loadsave\_addr}}).
                    \item non zero, will use this number as the load address
                    when loading the file (i.e. 
                    \textit{\hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{DISK\_loadsave\_addr}}).
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Convert between HEX and DEC and ASCII}
    % ==========================================================================
    In many situations your programs will need to convert between different
    number notations (hexadecimal, decimal, ASCII). For example, all characters
    typed by the user are read by the function
    \hyperref[func:fbiosserialconina]{F\_BIOS\_SERIAL\_CONIN\_A}, which stores
    the ASCII value of the pressed key in the \texttt{A} register. In order to
    do manipulations of data, our program will need to convert this ASCII data
    into either hexadecimal or decimal notation.

    Take as an example the CLI command for saving files to disk (\textit{save}).
    As shown in the \textit{dastaZ80 User's Manual} section \textit{5.3 Disk
    Commands}, this command takes two parameters: \textit{$<$start\_address$>$},
    which is expressed in hexadecimal, and \textit{$<$number\_of\_bytes$>$}, which
    is expressed in decimal. But in both cases,
    \hyperref[func:fbiosserialconina]{F\_BIOS\_SERIAL\_CONIN\_A } will give
    us (in the \texttt{A} register) the ASCII representation of the numbers typed
    by the user.

    Before we can set a pointer to the memory address specified by 
    \textit{$<$start\_address$>$}, and set our counter to 
    \textit{$<$number\_of\_bytes$>$}, we need to convert those ASCII numbers
    into hexadecimal and decimal respectively.

    The Kernel, offers a series of functions to help the programmer with the
    conversions:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnasciiadrtohex]{F\_KRN\_ASCIIADR\_TO\_HEX}:
        Converts ASCII 4 chars to HEX 2 bytes. (e.g. 32 35 37 30 to \texttt{0x2570})
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnasciitohex]{F\_KRN\_ASCII\_TO\_HEX}: Converts
        ASCII 2 chars to HEX 1 byte. (e.g. 33 45 to \texttt{0x3E})
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnhextoascii]{KRN\_HEX\_TO\_ASCII}: Converts
        HEX 1 byte to ASCII 2 chars. (e.g. \texttt{0x3E} to 33 45)
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnbcdtobin]{F\_KRN\_BCD\_TO\_BIN}: Converts a
        byte of BCD to a byte of hexadecimal. (e.g. 12 is converted into \texttt{0x0C}).
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnbintobcd4]{F\_KRN\_BIN\_TO\_BCD4}: Converts HEX
        1 byte to DEC 4 digits. (e.g. \texttt{0x80} to 0128)
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnbintobcd6]{F\_KRN\_BIN\_TO\_BCD6}: Converts HEX
        2 bytes to DEC 6 digits. (e.g. \texttt{0xFFF} to 065535)
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnbcdtoascii]{F\_KRN\_BCD\_TO\_ASCII}: Converts
        DEC 6 digits to ASCII 6 chars. (e.g. 512 to 30 30 30 35 31 32)
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrnbintoascii]{F\_KRN\_BIN\_TO\_ASCII}: Converts
        HEX 2 bytes to ASCII string. (e.g. \texttt{0x7FFF} to 33 32 37 36 37)
        \item \hyperref[func:fkrndectobin]{F\_KRN\_DEC\_TO\_BIN}:
        Converts HEX n bytes to ASCII string. First byte tells the number of
        bytes to convert (e.g. 05 33 32 37 36 37 to \texttt{0x7FFF})
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Develop software for dzOS}
    % ==========================================================================

        % ==========================================================================
        \subsubsection{Available RAM}
        % ==========================================================================
        Programs can be loaded from disk to any area of \textbf{RAM}. Nevertheless,
        addresses below \texttt{0x4420} SHOULD not be used, at these contain the
        Operating System's variables. Modifying these without the proper care will
        result in undesired behaviour, system crash or even lost of data on the disk.
        Therefore, taking in consideration that the free RAM area starts at
        \texttt{0x4420} and ends at \texttt{0xFFFF}, the programmer can load
        programs of maximum 48,095 bytes (48 KB).

        % ==========================================================================
        \subsubsection{Storing your variables}
        % ==========================================================================
        Variables for programs can be store anywhere in the free \textbf{RAM} space.

        The OS is having its own internal variables that can be accessed by the user.
        Also, some variables are used only by CLI and therefore could be re-used
        during the execution of a program.\\

        Refer to the section \hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{System Variables (SYSVARS)}
        on this guide to know the exact locations.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \textbf{DISK Superblock} and \textbf{DISK BAT} areas can be
            re-used if you are not using \textbf{DISK} routines.
            \item The \textbf{CLI} area can safely be re-used in your program, as
            the CLI is not running meanwhile your program is.
            \item The \textbf{RTC} area can be re-used if you are not calling any
            \textbf{RTC} routines.
            \item The \textbf{Math} area can be re-used if you are not calling any
            \textbf{Math} routines.
            \item The \textbf{SIO}, \textbf{Generic} and \textbf{VDP} areas MUST not
            be touched.
        \end{itemize}

        All in all, you may end up having some extra 700 bytes here.

        % ==========================================================================
        \subsubsection{Receiving parameters from CLI}
        % ==========================================================================
        When a user types a command in CLI, the entered command is stored in an area
        of 64 bytes in the \hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{System Variables (SYSVARS)} 
        called \textit{CLI\_buffer\_full\_cmd}. From there, you can read the full
        command, which will be the name of your binary program, and the parameter or
        parameters.

        % ==========================================================================
        \subsubsection{Returning to CLI}
        % ==========================================================================

        If your program allows the user to return to CLI, it must then jump to the
        loop subroutine known as \textit(CLI Prompt). The address of this subroutine
        is stored in the \hyperref[sec:ram_memmap]{System Variables (SYSVARS)}
        \textit{CLI\_prompt\_addr}.

        Simply make your program to load the value stored at that location and jump
        (\textit{jp}) to it.

        % ==========================================================================
        \subsubsection{Developing with Z80 Assembler}
        % ==========================================================================
        In order for dzOS to know where to load the program in \textbf{RAM}, the
        executable code must provide the load address. For compatibility with SDCC
        \footnote{Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) is a retargettable, optimizing
        Standard C (ANSI C89, ISO C99, ISO C11) compiler suite that targets (amongst
        others) the Zilog Z80 based MCUs. (http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/)}, we will
        store it in the bytes 3 and 4 of the executable.

        For programs developed in Z80 Assembler, add the following at the top of the
        source code:

        % \lstset{language={[z80]Assembler}}
        \begin{lstlisting}
        .ORG    $4420           ; start of code at
                                ;   start of free RAM
        jp      $4425           ; first instruction
                                ;   must jump to the
                                ;   executable code
        .BYTE   $20, $44        ; load address
                                ;   (values must be
                                ;   same as .org above)

        .ORG    $4425           ; start of program
                                ;   (must be same as jp above)
        ; your program here
        \end{lstlisting}

        The first .ORG (\textit{.ORG \$4420}) indicates the start address used for
        creating the binary file after compilation.

        \texttt{0x4420} is where the \hyperref[subsec:memmap:ram]{Free RAM}
        starts, giving you 48 KB for your program. Programs SHOULD not be loaded
        at a lower address, for the reason explained before.

        The first instruction MUST be a jump (\textit{jp}) instruction to the actual
        executable code (i.e. your program code) The \textit{.BYTE} instruction just
        inserts the two bytes after the jump instruction. The values MUST be in
        hexadecimal little-endian format.

        Because the jp instruction in Z80 is translated as \textit{C3 nn nn} (where
        \textit{nn} are the bytes where to jump), this will use the first three
        bytes (\texttt{0x00}, \texttt{0x01}, \texttt{0x02}) in the binary, therefore
        we store the load address at bytes 3 and 4 and your program can start just
        after, at byte \texttt{0x05}.

        Once assembled, the binary will be loaded by dzOS at the load address, and
        when executed, the first thing that will happen is a \textit{jp} instruction
        and then the execution will continue from the executable code of your
        program.

        If your program allows the user to return to CLI, add the following on your
        source code:

        % \lstset{language={[z80]Assembler}}
        \begin{lstlisting}
        ld      HL, (CLI_prompt_addr)   ; return control
        jp      (HL)                    ;   to CLI
        \end{lstlisting}

        For convenience, two files are provided in the Github repository
        \footnote{https://github.com/dasta400/dzSoftware}:
        \textit{\_header.inc} and \textit{\_template.asm}

        % ==========================================================================
        \subsubsection{Developing with SDCC}
        % ==========================================================================

        In the Github repository, there is a file (\textit{crt0.s} that sets:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the start address for the binary at \texttt{0x4420}
            \item the values \texttt{0x20} and \texttt{0x44} in the binary at bytes
            5 and 6.
            \item first instruction of your program to be started located at
            \texttt{0x4425}
        \end{itemize}

        Therefore, by using this file all programs will be loaded at the correct
        address.
